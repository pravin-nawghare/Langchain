# Langchain Framework

**LangChain Key Features and Functionality:**

**Table of Contents:**

1. **Chains**
2. **Prompt Management**
3. **Agents**
4. **Vector Database**
5. **Models**
6. **Memory Management**

### 1. **Chains**

- **Simple Chains**: Single LLM invocation
- **Multi-step Chains**: Multiple actions combined, with output from previous step

### 2. **Prompt Management**

- Manage and customize prompts passed to LLM
- Handle dynamic variables and prompt engineering

### 3. **Agents**

- Autonomous systems that take actions based on input data
- Leverage LLMs for decision-making and respond intelligently

### 4. **Vector Database**

- **Main Function**: Store and search high-dimensional vector representations of data
- **Functionality**: Enhance responses with dynamic, real-time data
The Vector Database allows LangChain models to access and incorporate dynamic information into their responses, enabling more informed and contextually aware interactions.

### 5. **Models**

- **Model-agnostic**: Supporting LLMs like GPT, Hugging Face models
- **Functionality**: Choose the best model for use case

### 6. **Memory Management**

- Allow LLM to "remember" context from previous interactions
- Handle sequential conversations with context tracking
