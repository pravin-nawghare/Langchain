# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML Pipeline
An **end-to-end machine** learning project to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The pipeline connects to a MongoDB database for data ingestion, preprocesses the data, trains classification models focused on minimizing false positives, and deploys the best model in AWS. A FastAPI-based web app provides a user interface, and GitHub Actions powers the CI/CD pipeline.
    
## Pipeline Details
### Data Collection
Customer usage and subscription data is pulled from MongoDB.
### Preprocessing
Cleans missing and inconsistent values.
Applies encoding, normalization, and feature engineering.
Splits data into train/test sets using stratified sampling.
### Model Training
Multiple classifiers tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Hyperparameter tuning applied as needed.
### Model Evaluation
Primary Metric: Recall (due to class imbalance).
Goal: Reduce false positives to avoid misclassifying loyal customers.
Best-performing model is selected and saved.
### Model Deployment
Final model is serialized and uploaded to AWS S3.
Ready for inference via API or frontend.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Automated workflows handle:
Code linting & style checks
Unit tests
Model training and evaluation
Deployment to cloud (AWS)

## Frontend (FastAPI)
A simple FastAPI web interface allows telecom customer data to be submitted for real-time churn prediction.
To run locally:
uvicorn webapp.main:app --reload

## Getting Started
- Clone the Repo
- Install Dependencies
- Start the Web App
